# Project_Euler_in_Julia
This is a jupyter notebook for me to work through solutions to the Project Euler challenges using the Julia programming language.

I am aiming to first approach the problems in an obvious or blunt way, then consider possible refinements for speed or clarity.

This is more a tool for me to start to familiarise myself with Julia than anything else, and in most cases I am partially translating my Python solutions into Julia.
